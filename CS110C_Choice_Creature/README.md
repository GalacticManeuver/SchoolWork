Choice Creature was made as an Honors project for CS 110C Data Structures & Algorithms: C++
The program hold information in cards and can keep the cards in multiple distinct states. It has the capability to have cards fight like in Magic the Gathering, though only with a few key words. It can also assess cards and sort them based on how good it thinks they would do verses a target card.

The project goal was to learn about different data structures and algorithms. Other goals were to learn proper commenting, UML, and decomposition to create a fully object oriented program.
