Restaurant was made as an Honors project for CS 150A Intro to SQL Databases & NoSQL

This database is a database of restaurants and restaurant reviews. Being a normalized MySQL database,
this database uses a minimum of memory, so server costs should be lower. It is set up to act as a part of
a restaurant social media website and not only holds information relevant to individual customers, but
also corporate customers.

This database is designed to be used with a website or app, but this project is just about the database.
The user interface, e.g. website or app, is outside of the scope of this project.
